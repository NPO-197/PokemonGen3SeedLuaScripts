# PokemonGen3SeedLuaScripts
  A repo of Lua Scripts to Visualize the RNG in Generation 3 pokemon games.  
  Original Code from Admiral-Fish's 3rd gen rng bot.lua  
  https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/luascripts/blob/master/Gen3/3rd%20gen%20rng%20bot.lua  
  Modified to display RNG Seed / Distance by NPO-197  

  Use the VBA-RR for VBA and the BizHawk for mGBA on BizHawk

  IMPORTANT! You MUST first define the variable 'Version' based on which Pokemon game you are playing,
  as in, Emerald USA, Ruby/Sapphire JPN, LeafGreen/FireRed PAL, ect...  
  You can do this by opening the .lua file in a text editor.
